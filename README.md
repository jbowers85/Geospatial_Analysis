# Geospatial_Analysis
Examples of different geospatial plots on maps using OpenAddresses.io and City of Seattle data

This repository is meant to provide examples of how to plot data on a map in R.  

### Sections:

1.)  Mapping - Density Plot - OpenAddresses.io Address Data - Portland, Oregon  
- The housing density is plotted using addresses from OpenAddresses.io that reside in the Portland, OR area

2.)  Mapping - Dot Plot - Seattle.gov Income Restricted Housing Data - Seattle, Washington
- The income restricted housing is plotted using data from the city of Seattle

**Geospatial Analysis**: The gathering, display, manipulation, and application of analytic techniques to data which has a geographical or spatial aspect. 

## Getting Started

You can access the data from OpenAddresses.io and the City of Seattle (linked below) by following along with the R code.     
[OpenAddresses.io](https://s3.amazonaws.com/data.openaddresses.io/openaddr-collected-us_west.zip)  
[City of Seattle](https://data.seattle.gov/api/views/b6zn-zsin/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD)  

Alternatively, you can save the files in this repository to your working directory to follow along:  
("OpenAddresses_USWest.zip", and "Seattle_IncomeRestrictedHousing.csv").
  
If using this code within R Studio, collapse all sections by pressing Alt + O for easier navigation between sections.
